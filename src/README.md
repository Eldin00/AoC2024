My solutions in Rust for the AoC 2024 puzzles.

A few notes:
Because this is something I'm doing in my free time for "Internet Points", 
* I'm not worrying much about making crash-proof code.
* I'm assuming all inputs are valid. 
* I'm not writing tests.

Because of the above, please don't consider what I've written here to be an example of "good code".
